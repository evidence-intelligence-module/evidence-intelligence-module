Preface

Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), being implemented in the country from 2016, with the
aim to support agriculture production by providing crop insurance against comprehensive risks
throughout the crop season. The Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare (DA&FW), Ministry
of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare (MoA&FW), Government of India (Gol), is the nodal agency for
executing PMFBY. The operational guidelines for smooth implementation of PMFBY were
documented in 2016 and revised, revamped and restructured in 2018, 2020 and 2023 respectively,
and made available to all the stakeholders (www.pmfby.gov.in).

Crop yield estimates of the Insurance Units ([Us) for the current and past years form the basis for crop
loss assessment and indemnity payout under PMFBY. Crop yield estimation is done through Crop
Cutting Experiments (CCEs), the traditional system of manual yield measurements in randomly
selected field plots for each crop in each IU. Major limitations of CCE based crop yield estimation
includes (a) limited number of measurements tends to produce higher standard error, (b) time-
consuming process, (c) manpower intensive and (d) vulnerable to human errors.

DA&FW has taken up many initiatives to improve crop yield estimation procedures ever since the
launch of PMFBY. Technology development agencies from both Government and Private sectors have
been engaged for developing new yield estimation methods using various datasets and models
through pilot studies.

‘The objective of these pilot studies was to generate reliable yield estimates through scalable models
for paddy and wheat crops at IU level. These studies were conducted during 2019 and 2020 for both
the kharif and the rabi seasons for selected crops and districts across different agro-climatic zones of
India. The Expert Committee, comprising of experts from Remote Sensing & GIS, Agriculture and
Data Science domains, carried out detailed evaluation of pilot studies and recommended five
approaches for yield estimation for nation-wide rollout covering paddy and wheat crops from the
2023 crop season onwards.

‘Towards enabling large scale adoption of technology-based yield estimates in PMFBY system for crop
loss assessment, DA&FW has conceptualised a special initiative i.e., “Yield Estimation System based
on Technology (YES-TECH)” under PMFBY. YES-TECH advocates the blended use of modelled and
CCE yield estimates for insurance claim assessment from Kharif 2023 season onwards. In this
connection, this document shall act as a guide and manual for the concerned ‘Stakeholders’, i.e., the
Centre, the States/UTs, the insurance companies (ICs), Mentor Institutions for Technology Rollout
(MITR) and the Technology Implementation Partners (TIP), for the national level rollout of YES-TECH.
DA&FW has constituted the YES-TECH committee with the following mandate:

+ Preparation of SOP for each technology model(s)/approach(es) approved by Gol for various
crops.

+ Creating panel of Technology Implementation Partners (TIP) from which States/UTs can select
aTIP for implementation.

+ Suggesting Mentor Institutions for Technology Rollout (MITRs ~ friend) to help the States/UTs in
rolling out YES-TECH.

+ Preparation of Model Tender document for on-boarding of TIPs by States/UTs.
+ Proposing amendments in the relevant guidelines, if required.

+ Support to States/UTs for preparing tender documents.

+ Monitoring and evaluation of YES-TECH implementation progress.

+ Any otherissues related to comprehensive roll out of YES-TECH

Executive Summary

Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), is a yield-guarantee scheme over an insured area.
Hence, the data on crop yield estimates over Insurance Units for the current and past years are
crucial for crop loss assessment and indemnity payout. Current system of crop yield estimation using
the yield measurements of Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) is often reported to be prone to different
errors. Therefore, DA&FW initiated pilot studies on technology-based crop yield estimation for paddy
and wheat, in the recent years. The results of these pilot studies have been evaluated and the Expert
Committee has recommended for upscaling these methods.

Accordingly, DA&FW has initiated nation-wide rollout of Yield Estimation System based on
Technology (YES-TECH), from kharif 2023, towards enabling large scale adoption of technology-
based yield estimates for yield loss and insurance claim assessments under PMFBY. The Department
has constituted an Expert Committee for YES-TECH which has undertaken several rounds of
consultations with various stakeholders and prepared the current document to enable
implementation of YES-TECH by States. The purpose of YES-TECH is to blend the technology-based
yield estimates with manual yield estimates and reduce the dependence on manual system
gradually. It is recommended that the modelled yield should be given at least 30% in the blending
approach.

Crops and choice of yield models to be covered under YES-TECH are notified from time to time based
on the maturity level of technology models. The crop-model matrix, currently identified for roll out
and referred in this document covers paddy and wheat with five models for yield estimation. SOPs for
all the five notified models are provided. States are expected to select a model of their choice in
consultation with experts and stake holders.

Structured system for YES-TECH implementation has been proposed to make the entire process
more systematic, timely, objective and transparent. Technology Implementation Partner (TIP) agency
selected by State will implement the selected yield model under the guidance and supervision of an
expert agency called Mentor Institute for Technology Roll-out (MITR) which is nominated by Gol.
Guidelines for selection of TIP either through nomination or tendering route are furnished. Similarly,
the list of MITR agencies which are Government entities like ISRO, ICAR etc has also been furnished.
Financial support for states for implementing YES-TECH is also indicated.

Roles and responsibilities of States, Insurance Companies, TIP and MITR agencies are well
documented. Towards ensuring discipline in the implementation, timelines for submission of
reports on work progress during the season and end-of-season have been stipulated. A system for
payments to TIP linked with work progress is developed. Penalty system for violation of timelines and
grievance redressal and disputes resolution framework have also been represented. Model
documents on (a) tender process for selection of TIP and (b) Tripartite Agreement between State, TIP
and MITR are also provided.

The Government of India (Gol) has the authority to clarify, amend, withdraw, or review any provisions
of the YES-TECH manual. The YES-TECH Committee is responsible for the overall execution and
monitoring of YES-TECH, including the empanelment of MITRs, TIPs, and the selection of districts for
implementation.

Thus, the current document covers all aspects of YES-TECH implementation and acts as a reference
guide for smooth roll-out of such a major technology intervention under PMFBY. Further, the
document will be updated with additional crops and suitable technology models from time to time,
thus supporting all future initiatives too on improving crop yield data under insurance.

1. Introduction

Globally, agriculture is exposed to multiple hazards leading to frequent crop losses. As a
result, crop insurance has become an indispensable risk management tool in the agriculture
sector. Better management of agricultural risks is one of the important strategies to address
the current challenges of food security, income security, and climate resilience in Indian
agriculture. Increasing crop risks coupled with low growth and outreach of crop insurance
signifies the huge potential for crop insurance in India. Therefore, a robust system of crop
insurance is the need of the hour to reduce the impact of covariate risks in agriculture and
promote innovations and investments in the farming sector.

Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) being implemented in the country from Kharif
2016, is an area yield index insurance that has many improved features to compensate for
multiple risks during the entire life cycle of the crop season. The use of technologies viz.
remote sensing, mobile and data analytics is mandatory for the effective implementation of
the scheme. The Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare (DA&FW), Ministry of
Agriculture and Farmers Welfare (MoA&FW), Government of India (Gol), is the nodal agency
for executing PMFBY in the country.

Area-yield insurance is a yield guarantee scheme over the specified area. It adopts an area
approach defining the Unit Area of Insurance known as an Insurance Unit (IU), generally
coinciding with a group of villages called Gram Panchayat (GP). Crop yield estimates of the IU
for the current and past years form the basis for crop loss assessment and indemnity pay-out.
Acertain per cent, 70%, 80%, or 90% of the average yield of the past five best out of seven years
of an IU called Threshold Yield (TY) is guaranteed for the current year. Actuarial premium
rates are determined at the district level for each crop based on the IU's past risk profiles in the
district. The current year's yield shortfall from the TY of the crop in the IU is applied to the sum
insured for calculating the pay-out (www.pmfby.gov.in)

Currently, Crop yield estimation is done by carrying out Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs),
i.e,, manual yield measurements at a randomly selected limited number of field plots for each
crop in each IU. The limited number of measurements leading to higher standard errors of
estimates and their proneness to subjectivity have become major constraints in generating
reliable yield estimates. As a result, the estimated yield of an IU tends to be biased leading to
disputes and delays in claims settlements. Thus, the challenge in the area-yield crop
insurance in India continues to be improving the crop yield estimation system.

Technology interventions, in the form of using satellite data, long-term weather datasets, and
usage of mobile apps for CCEs and collecting crop pictures, to improve crop yield estimation
and crop damage assessment, are largely recognized and promoted. Technology based
estimation is largely based on documenting the edaphic factors, weather and its changes as it
occurs in the entire period the crop is on ground (from seed to harvest) and how the health of
crop was impacted by it, and is reflective of the potential of the crop yield that has materialized
in the season, cutting across all varieties and farming practices. ‘These technology-based
estimations are unbiased and when used in conjunction with CCE estimates results in
betterment of final yield estimates. DA&FW has taken up many initiatives to improve crop
yield estimation procedures ever since the launch of PMFBY in 2016 (www.pmfby.gov.in).
Technology development agencies of both Government and Private sectors are currently
developing tools and methodologies for crop yield estimation and crop damage assessment
methods, using various datasets, models, and analysis techniques for improving crop loss
assessment in crop insurance.

1.1, YES-TECH, CROPIC & WINDS

‘Towards introducing and catalysing nationwide, large scale adoption of technology-based
solutions under PMFBY, DA&FW has conceptualised to amalgamate the system for
technology-based yield-estimation and crop damage assessment under the umbrella of YES-

---

<!-- Page 15 -->

TECH i.e., Yield Estimation System based on Technology. YES-TECH advocates the blended
use of modelled and CCE yield-estimates for insurance claim assessment from Kharif 2023
season onwards. Under YES-TECH, it has been envisaged to develop a database system for
aggregating crop health photographs taken at periodic intervals, i.e., Collection of Real ‘Time
Observations & Photographs of Crops (CROPIC), to ascertain the temporal health of the crops
and use the picture analytics results as an input into crop yield estimation and to build a two-
step mechanism to handle issues related to add-on claims.

In the context of the crop insurance schemes in India, weather data is extremely important to
mitigate the hardships of the insured farmers against likelihood of anticipated crop losses.
Weather datasets are relevant to multiple perils under PMFBY, such as inundation due to
flood or rainfall, cyclones, cloudbursts, landslides, drought etc. Restructured Weather Based
Crop Insurance Scheme (RWBCIS), which represents a major chunk of Crop Insurance
business in India is totally dependent on accurate and reliable weather data sets for
quantifying crop losses suffered by the farmers. Historical weather datasets are also required
for working out the actuarial premium rates and for designing of the term sheet. The
Operational Guidelines of RWBCIS mandates to ensure 100% of weather data must be from
Automatic Weather Station (AWS) & Automatic Rain Gauge (ARG) only and the same must be
installed and notified at the lowest possible level of administrative hierarchy. In view of the
above, DA&FW has envisaged to set up a wider national level network of AWS & ARGs and
creating a strong and resilient platform i.e., Weather Information and Network Data System
(WINDS), which will consist of the existing AWS/ARG network established by Indian
Meteorological Department (IMD) and various States/UTs. This huge weather dataset,
integrated on a single platform, can be used by the respective State/UT Governments for crop
insurance, sowing, cropping, harvesting and market planning, and consultation and
advisories to the farmers. This nationally important data, thus generated may also be
promoted and nurtured for wider applications, research and strategic utilization, for bringing
in efficiencies and transparency in service delivery to the consumers, in different sectors.

The weather and pictorial datasets and information products generated under WINDS and
CROPIC initiatives will be ofimmense value to strengthen YES-TECH implementation.

1.2. YES-TECH Pilot Studies

During the past seasons (2016-2022) of Kharif and Rabi, DA&FW engaged various technical
agencies/experts/research bodies (Government/ private; national/international) and
rigorously started conducting pilot studies for GP level yield estimation, for Cereal & Non-
Cereal crops, through several innovative technologies/data like high spatial and temporal
resolution remote sensing data, long-term soil & weather data, crop yield data, Advanced
intelligent crop simulation models, Artificial intelligence/machine learning, Internet of
Things (loT), Crop Photo analytics, Advanced Statistics, etc. These pilot studies were
conducted to assess the outcome and findings for taking decisions which will help in deciding
the best available methodology /strategy for technology-based yield estimation at GP level,
while minimizing the errors.

The objective of these pilot studies was to generate reliable & scalable technology-based yield
estimates and crop damage assessment procedures for all crops notified under PMFBY, at the
smallest administrative unit, i.e., Gram Panchayat (GP). These studies were conducted during
2019 and 2020 for both the Kharif and the Rabi seasons for selected crops and districts across
different agro climatic zones of India. After detailed analysis, five approaches were
recommended by the Expert Committee for the national-level rollout of technology-based
yield estimation for the Paddy and Wheat crops from the 2023 crop season onwards. Pilot
studies for other major crops, have already been initiated in kharif 2022 and rabi 2022-23
seasons, as per the recommendation of the competent authority of the Central Government
and the recommended approaches for the same will be notified separately from time to time
within the tender duration, as a corrigendum/amendment to this Manual.

1.3. Rationale for Implementing YES-TECH

1.3.1, Results of pilot studies on technology-based yield estimation carried-out by different agencies
with the support of DA&FW, are promising as per the observations of the Expert Committee
constituted by DA&FW.

1.3.2, All the approaches which have been recommended by the expert committee under YES-TECH,
use well established models for which peer reviewed research is available, and these models
are in open source and thoroughly tested under Indian conditions.

1.3.3. Increasing acceptance to technology-based yield estimation by States/UTs and other
stakeholders and proactive steps already taken by some of the States like Maharashtra and
Madhya Pradesh to adopt technology-based yield estimation under PMFBY.

1.3.4. Technology-based yield estimation shall be implemented on graded scale i.e., minimum 30 %
weightage of Technology driven yield in the first year and 70% to traditional Crop Cutting
Experiments approach subject to fulfilment of conditions, especially generation of crop maps
with desired level of statistical accuracy, as stipulated in YES-TECH manual.

1.3.5. The concept of assigning the weightage to model derived yield estimates is meant for improving
the accuracy of final yield estimates and reducing moral hazards and manual interventions,
however the conventional CCEs (to be captured through CCE Agri app) will be continued as
usual.

1.3.6. YES-TECH proposal has been widely discussed with all the stakeholders implementing
PMFBY, at different forums and inputs and feedbacks received thereof have been
incorporated into this document.

1.4. Scope of this document

1.4.1. Documentation of technical procedures, guidelines and protocols for implementing
technology-based yield estimation models of YES-TECH under PMFBY.

1.4.2. To define the roles and responsibilities of the Stakeholders implementing YES-TECH, and
their empanelment/selection criteria.

1.5. Crop - Model Matrix (CMM)

1.5.1, CMM represent the combination of crops and technology models approved for yield estimation
under PMFBY. Crops and technology models notified under this manual shall only be eligible
for calculating Crop Insurance claims under PMFBY.

1.5.2. CMM-1 covering wheat and paddy is being rolled out through the current document itself.
Under CMM-1, five approaches are recommended covering 9 States are mentioned in
Appendix 1.

1.5.3. Gol will notify subsequent CMMs from time to time based on the recommendations of YES-
TECH Committee.

1.5.4. Upon such notifications on subsequent CMMs relevant details will be added as appendices to
this manual.

1.5.5. YES-TECH shall be implemented in the districts where satellite-based crop mapping, of the
target crop is technically feasible, as specified in the subsequent chapters of this document.

1.5.6. Special Exemption from CMM-1 Framework: Since the states of Madhya Pradesh and
Maharashtra had implemented technology-based yield estimation from Kharif 2022 as per
approval given by Gol vide letter dated 17th June 2022 , as a special dispensation for them,
nothing in this clause will apply to the states of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra for Crops

other than those mentioned in CMM-1, provided that technology based yield estimation for
these crops is implemented within the purview and administrative framework defined in this
Manual.

1.5.7. Extending the coverage of CMM-1 to other states will be done from 2024 Kharif season
onwards.

2. YES-TECH Implementation Framework

2.1. With the support of the current manual, States/UTs shall select a TIP and a MITR from the list
ofagencies empanelled by Gol.

4. Models under YES-TECH framework
4.1. Models under CMM-1

1, Semi-physical model

2. Al/ML models

3. Crop simulation models

4. Ensemble models (Al/ Crop Simulation/ Semi-physical ete.,)

5. Parametric index of crop performance (Indirect approach)
4.1.1. Semi-physical model

4.1.1.1. This method is based on Radiation Use Efficiency (RUE) model proposed by Monteith, 1977.
This model is based on the bio-chemical process of plant-light absorption for
photosynthesis, radiation use efficiency, stress factors, accumulated biomass, and grain
yield. Its strength lies in adopting a process-based framework with limited parameterization.
It is recognized as a better approach than simple empirical modelling. Critical elements of
the RUE model include (a) reliable information on crop planting and harvest dates and (b)
derivation of water stress and temperature stress factors.

---

<!-- Page 24 -->

4.1.1.2. Temperature and water stress are the two important limiting factors and quantifying these
two parameters at local scales like Us remains a big challenge. This model would result in
potential yield rather than actual yield if the stress factors are not accounted using right
data and technique. The model cannot be applied for part of the season because constant
RUE is applicable only when the entire crop-growing season is considered. Moderate
resolution (10-30m) NDVI and LSWI datasets throughout the crop season are to be used. In
the event of non-availability of 10-30m data, MODIS 250m data may be used. Use of FAPAR
data of MODIS and Sentinels are suggested. Harvest index (HI) can be derived from the
historical CCE datasets (biomass and grain yield).

4.1.2. AI/ML Models (Machine Learning / Deep Learning)

4.1.2.1. Crop yield has high variability across space and time owing to variations in weather,
edaphic, management factors, and genotypes. Spectral data of a crop is the integrated
manifestation of the effect of all the above factors, and hence, satellite data has a significant
role in regional crop yield assessment. Remote sensing based spectral data has been
incorporated into different statistical, agro-meteorological, and simulation models for crop
yield assessment.

4.1.2.2. Artificial Intelligence (Al) has gained importance in solving the non-linear relationships
between variables. Al includes Machine Learning and Deep Learning models, such as the
random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and different variants of neural network
models (NN). In recent years, Al models have gained momentum in crop yield estimation due
to certain inherent advantages with these models. Satellite-derived vegetation indices,
meteorological data, hydrological variables, and edaphic factors are being used in these
models.

4.1.3. Crop simulation models

4.1.3.1.Crop growth models simulate the plant processes to estimate various bio-physical
parameters and final crop yield. These models need intensive parameterization starting from
genetic coefficients of crop variety under cultivation, crop sowing time, crop management
practices ~ fertilizer applications, irrigation supplies, pest/disease occurrence, ete. These
are highly reliable point-based or location-specific models due to the availability of input
parameters in experimental plots.

4.1.3.2. Input data in the model includes daily max & min temperature, daily solar radiation, daily
rainfall, soil data - depth wise texture, bulk density, pH, organic carbon, water holding
capacity, etc., Start of the sowing and irrigation information can be derived from satellite
images and other management factors can be taken from the standard local practices.

4.1.3.3. Model calibration and validation approaches are required for each selected model for the
selected crop. The simulation models are sensitive to the genetic coefficients of the crop. A
proper varietal-based approximation of genetic coefficients is required at the disaggregated
level before simulating the crop yield. The modelling approach often remains lumped in
absence of spatial input parameters unless space-based inputs are assimilated or externally
incorporated. The insurance units or agro ecologies with highly varying biophysical
conditions need careful consideration on using simulation models and their yield
extrapolation.

4.1.4, Ensemble models (Machine Learning/Crop Simulation /Semi-physical)

4.1.4.1. An ensemble approach to yield estimation involves combining the predictions of multiple
models to make a final estimation. This can be done through various techniques such as
model averaging, model voting, or more sophisticated methods such as stacking.

---

<!-- Page 25 -->

4.1.4.2. One advantage of using an ensembled approach is that it can potentially improve the
accuracy of the final prediction by reducing the variance of the individual models. This is
because the individual models may make different errors, and by combining their
predictions, the errors may cancel out to some extent.

4.1.4.3. To use an ensembled approach for yield estimation, one has to train multiple models on the
same dataset. Different types of models can be used such as decision trees, support vector
machines, or neural networks, or we could use the same type of model with different hyper
parameter settings. These models can be clubbed with mechanistic approaches too.

4.1.4.4, There are several benefits of using an ensembled approach for yield estimation:

1. Increased accuracy: By combining the predictions of multiple models, the ensembled
approach can often provide more accurate predictions than any single model. This is
because the individual models may have different strengths and weaknesses, and the
ensembled approach can take advantage of the strengths of each model while
minimizing the impact of their weaknesses.

2. Reduced variance: Using an ensembled approach can also reduce the variance of the
predictions, which can be especially useful when the individual models are prone to
overfitting or have high variance in their predictions.

3. Improved generalization: An ensembled approach can also improve the generalization
of the model, meaning it can make more accurate predictions on unseen data.

4.1.5. Parametric Index - Crop Health Factor (CHF)

4.1.5.1.CHF is a composite index of crop performance incorporating multiple physical and
biophysical parameters related to crop health. It is a quantitative measure of crop health
and its overall performance.

4.1.5.2. The research findings that can establish the rationale for adopting CHF are (a) objectively
measured yield-proxy-index is a better choice than subjectivity-prone manual yield
estimates to design crop insurance contracts, (b) currently satellite and weather datasets
permit more objective assessment of crop health at moderate spatial and temporal scales, (c)
composite indicators are effective to simplify the complex processes into easily understood
simple comparisons.

4.2. Accounting for end-of-season crop risks (applicable to all models)

4.2.1. There are certain crop risks that need to be accounted separately in modelled yield, because
they are not parameterized in the model. Therefore, a Correction Factor approach is
developed here to correct the modelled yield for such risks which include:

i, Unseasonal rains/Floods/ Cyclones (submergence, lodging, panic harvest ete.)

ii, Weather aberrations such as hot and dry winds, rise in temperatures (poor grain setting
and grain development)

iii, Weather induced pest/disease incidence, etc.

4.2.2. Mostly, these risks occur during reproductive stage of crops ~ flowering to harvest period,
during the last 30-40 days of crop’s life cycle i.e., before crop harvest.

4.2.3. The methodology framework for generating Correction Factor for accounting the impact of
such crop risks occurring the terminal part of season, has two components namely:

a) detecting the affected /exposed area in each Insurance Unit and

b) crop loss fraction in such area.

---

<!-- Page 26 -->

4.2.4, Triggers for initiating the analysis for accounting such risks shall be decided by the states in
consultation with MITR and will inter alia include:

a) Excess/Unseasonal rainfall
b) Wind speed

c) Relative Humidity

d) Temperature

e) Any additional weather parameter.

4.2.5. Affected area is derived using, (a) satellite-based harvest area maps, (b) satellite indices
before and after the risk events in the current year and (c) satellite indices of past year(s) with
no risk events.

4.2.6. Yield loss fractions are to be generated based on anomalies detected by satellite indices. The
indices of current season are compared with that of recent past two to three normal years
(which is decided by States in advance). It is to be ensured that crop stage is more or less
same between the years of comparison for meaningful outcomes.

4.2.7. A look-Up-Table (LUT) is prepared based on previous studies and experiences to arrive at
crop losses. While it is not practical to set these limits truly representing the real loss, a
liberal approach with a reasonable trade-off is formulated here for the benefit of farmers as
well as for ICs for easy settlement of claims,

4.2.8. LUTs for computing Correction Factors for accounting for certain crop risks are given below
in Table 2. The values mentioned in the LUT’ are indicative in nature. The % reduction in
yield due to various risks mentioned in the Table 2 can be improved using other sources of
objective data such as CCE yield, in consultation with MITR and State /UT Governments.

4.2.9. Computation of final estimate

Area weighted approach is followed to arrive at final estimate of modelled-yield or CHF for
each IU, using percent area affected and percent of yield / CHF loss in the affected area.

5. Conditions in YES-TECH implementation
5.1. Modelimplementation for past years

5.1.1. It is mandatory to implement these models as per the manual for the current and past years
from 2017 onwards. Model implementation for past years ensures consistency in the model
performance as well as outputs and builds confidence among the implementing
stakeholders.

5.1.2. These approaches have been recommended by the expert committee after analysing results
obtained from multiple pilot studies. The models have been validated against independent
CCEs conducted by the implementing agencies and the CCE data collected under PMFBY.

5.1.3. Running the Yield Models on the historical datasets, including remote sensing Images,
Weather & Soil parameters, and CCE Yield datasets will help to better fine tune the models,
resulting in robust modelling framework and will set a baseline for future improvements.

5.1.4. The model outputs of past years shall not be used for (a) making comparisons with other
datasets, (b) revising the loss assessments of past years, and (c) challenging the estimates of
current/past years

---

<!-- Page 28 -->

5.1.5. No challenges or appeals against the past years’ yield estimates shall be entertained in any
court of law or appellate authority. Past estimates will fall within the category of “intellectual
property” under section 8(1)(d) of the Right to Information Act, 2005, and not be made
public. These datasets are used to understand the model consistency and security, and can
be shared with relevant stakeholders for technical usage as per the data and information
sharing protocols notified by the YES-TECH Committee.

5.2. Recommended end use of model outputs

Blending of modelled crop yields or CHF with CCE-yield estimates is suggested for arriving
at yield-based crop loss estimates and claim assessments from Kharif 2023 crop season
onwards.

5.2.1. Direct and Indirect Approach for Yield estimation

5.2.1.1. At least 30% weightage is to be assigned to modelled yield. Composite yield estimate will be
generated by assigning 70% weightage to CCE yield and 30% weightage to modelled yield,
and this blended yield estimate will be used for arriving at yield loss assessments.

8.2.1.2. In case of Crop Health Factor (CHF), 70% weightage is to be assigned to CCE-yield deviation
from its threshold and 30% weightage to CHF deviation from its threshold.

5.2.1.3. States can increase the weightage for modelled yield at their discretion and there is no upper
cap on weightage to be given to modelled yield. It is to be noted that the weight to be assigned
to modelled yield needs to be declared in the beginning of crop season in the PMFBY tender
documents for Kharif 2023 season and subsequently by way of a specific notification by the
concerned State/UT before the start of every season.

5.2.2. Implications of blended approach

5.2.2.1. The blending approach would lead to improved loss assessment mechanism under PMFBY,
by minimizing the limitations that are inadvertently present in the sole dependence on
manual CCE estimates.

5.2.2.2. The basis for assigning 30% weightage to technology can be drawn from the facts that the
benefit of technology adoption can be realised only when significant weightage is assigned to
the outcome. Such minimum weightage is needed to result in a meaningful impact on the
final yield estimates.

5.2.2.3, Here it may be noted that the aim of YES-TECH rollout is not to replace the CCEs entirely,
but to improve upon the yield estimates and to reduce the dependency on CCEs in a
graduated manner.

5.2.2.4. It is to be noted that the purpose of implementing YES-TECH is to improve the accuracy of
yield estimation and loss assessment in the current year. The modelled outputs are not
meant for changing AY and TY values for the current year.

5.2.2.5. The Threshold Yield (TY) for 1st season of YES-TECH rollout will be calculated from the
previous season’s Actual Yield (CCE based). For subsequent seasons, YES-TECH derived
Yield estimates will be incorporated for TY calculation.

5.3. Financialimplications

Implementation of any model under YES-TECH involves cost considerations for field data
collection, crop mapping, procurement of satellite & weather datasets, model training, and
validation, setting up of infrastructural facilities, computational facilities, model training,
and validation, data analysis, expert knowledge, etc. All these inputs and factors will
contribute towards the overall implementation of YES-TECH.

<!-- Page 29 -->

5.3.1. Cost of implementing the YES-TECH shall be shared between Central and State
Government on sunset basis as mentioned in Table 3 below:

Table 3: Financial arrangement for implementing YES-TECH

S.No Particulars Sharing Ratio/Pattern between Central and
State Governments for YES-TECH

Himalayan States
2 Other States 90:10 80:20 60:40

5.3.2. Reference Cost for TIP for Implementing YES-TECH

5.3.2.1. On the basis of the pilot studies conducted by different agencies under PMFBY, the district
wise notional cost of implementing YES-TECH for a crop for a season works out to be
approximately Rs. 6-8 Lakhs, per district, for districts having approximately 5000 Ha under
target crop. This is only indicative cost incurred for collection of all the requisite
input/information and analysis of data in the limited districts of pilot studies. This shall be
taken as reference only.

5.3.2.2. However, the cluster wise actual cost of implementing YES-TECH for a crop in a season will
be discovered through the financial bidding process for the selection of private agencies as
TIPs.

5.3.2.3. The size and the grouping of the cluster shall conform with the PMFBY district clustering as
notified by the respective States /UTs.

5.3.2.4, For the State/UT Government agencies, which will be selected as TIP on nomination basis,
the cluster wise cost of implementing YES-TECH for a crop in a season will be the lowest of:

1. The national average of the cluster wise notional price discovered through the tendering
process for the selection of private agencies; OR

2. The cluster wise actual expenditure incurred by the State/UT Government agency
nominated as TIP for implementing YES-TECH for a crop in a season.

5.3.3. Payment to MITR

5.3.3.1. Up to 20% of YES-TECH implementation cost in a given State/UT can be paid to respective
MITR, for meeting the following requirement while discharging their responsibilities in
YES-TECH:

1. Computer systems and software,

2. Hiring of contractual manpower (preferably in Remote Sensing & GIS and Data Science
domain),

3. Travel Expenses for YES-TECH related activities,
4, Other miscellaneous expenses,

5. Institutional overheads, if any.

5.3.3.2. The MITR will submit a detailed State wise Three-Year financial plan for the above with the
YES-TECH committee.

---

<!-- Page 30 -->

5.3.3.3, MNCFC/YES TECH Committee will examine the proposal submitted by MITR and the
admissible cost of infrastructure, manpower and other expenses, will be considered and
sanctioned for the tender cycle.

5.3.3.4, Infrastructure and Set-up Cost: YES-Tech committee shall recommend the quantum of
payment to be paid upfront as first instalment/ mobilization advance to MITRs, for meeting
of requisite infrastructure and set-up cost.

5.3.3.5.The balance payment shall be paid on actual cost basis on submission of
Bills/Invoice/ Expenditure Statement etc. by the MITR at regular intervals.

5.4. Usage of CCE-Agri App

5.4.1. The purpose of YES-TECH rollout is not to replace the CCEs entirely, but to reduce the
dependency on CCEs ina graduated manner.

5.4.2. CCEs will continue to be conducted by the respective State/UT departments in the same
way as earlier, following the relevant clauses of the Operational Guidelines of PMFBY.

5.4.3. In order to encourage the usage of CCE Agri app for capturing the Crop Cutting Experiments
(CCEs) by the States and to reduce moral hazards, it has also been decided to give additional
weightage to YES-TECH derived yield estimates in case a certain number of CCEs are not
conducted through CCE Agri app in a District for a particular crop ina season.

5.4.4. The additional weightage to be given to YES-TECH yield estimates in such case is provided in
Table 4 below:

Table 4: Additional weightage to YES-TECH yield estimates

% of CCEs recorded by Additional weightage to Total weightage to
CCE-Agri App YES-TECH yield YES-TECH yield
>= 75% 0% 30%

>= 50% &< 75% 5% 35%

>= 25% &<50% 10% 40%

>= 10% & <25 % 15% 45%
<10% 20% 50%

5.5. Other Conditions

5.5.1. The Threshold Yield (TY) for 1st season of YES-TECH rollout will be calculated from the
previous year’s Actual Yield (CCE based). For subsequent seasons, the blended yield

1. Semi Physical Approach

‘The methodology is based on the concept that the biomass produced by a crop is a function of the
amount of photo synthetically active radiation (PAR) absorbed, which in turn depends on incoming
radiation and the crop’s PAR interception capacity. Biomass is a function of the total photo
synthetically active radiation (PAR) and the ability of the plant to absorb (fAPAR) this radiation and to
convert this radiation to dry matter (RUE) and yield is a function of net dry matter and the harvest
index (HI) of the crop. Water Scalar derived from satellite images will be used as a limiting factor of
crop yield. Major factors of crop growth (i.e.) the radiation and the ability of the crop to convert the
absorbed radiation into dry matter) are derived and used for estimating the yield. Model framework
(flow chart) is furnished in Fig.3 below:

1.1 Methodology

‘The generation of an accurate crop map for the current and historical years is the first important
step in all the five approaches. Crop layers can be generated using SAR and Optical medium
resolution (5-30 m) satellite data. The standard widely adopted methodology must be followed for
crop mapping.

‘The classification procedure has to be performed for each district separately, and the outputs are to
be verified extensively by superimposing on cloud-free optical data of appropriate months when the
crop was at maximum vegetative phase. Field data points are used to check the classification
performance. It is to be ensured that commission errors are <10% and omission errors can be
accommodated up to 20%. By adopting this strategy on mapping error, the IU average crop health
indicators represent the crop pixels more closely.

1.2 Input data

Basic Input Data for Model development are Fraction of absorbed photo synthetically active radiation
(f{APAR), Photo synthetically active radiation (PAR), Radiation use efficiency (RUE), Water scalar, and
Harvest Index (HI) data will be used for yield estimation. Details of data product, satellite, Source, and
Granularity is given in Table 7 below:

Crop biomass and crop yield estimation
Crop Biomass estimation

+ Biomass is a function of the total photo synthetically active radiation (PAR) and the ability of the
plant to absorb ([APAR) this radiation and convert this radiation to dry matter (RUE). Radiation
Use Efficiency was the capacity of the plant to convert radiation into dry matter. The biomass had
been calculated from the following equation.

Crop Yield estimation

+ Yield is a function of net dry matter and the harvest index (HI) of the crop. Harvest index is the ratio
of crop grain yield and crop biomass. The crop yield had been calculated from the following
equation.

+ Yield =Biomass * Harvest Index (HI)
+ HI= Economic Yield/Biological yield
Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR)

+ Photo-synthetically active radiation (PAR) is the part of electromagnetic radiation that can be used
as the source of energy for photosynthesis by green plants.

Radiation Use Efficiency (RUE)

+ Plant biomass production can be modelled as a linear function of intercepted
photosynthetically active radiation (PAR).

+ The slope of this relationship is the RUE, which is approximately constant for forests and
natural ecosystems, and particularly for crops when growth is not limited by environmental
conditions.

+ Radiation-use efficiency (RUE) is defined as the ratio of dry matter produced per unit of radiant
energy used in its production. Because efficiency should be dimensionless, the term of “dry
matter: radiation quotient” was suggested, however, RUE is used widely and considered a
useful tool for simulating crop growth.

2. Machine Learning / Deep Learning approach (AI/ML models)

Machine learning models are non-parametric and captures the non-linear relationships between the
yield and the features influencing the yield. Machine learning can determine pattern and correlations
and develop the predictive model. The predictive model is built using several features, and as such,
parameters of the models are determined using historical data during the training phase. In recent
years, machine learning models have been used in various researches to improve the accuracy of
crop yield by incorporating satellite derived vegetation indices, meteorological data, hydrological
variables, edaphic factors etc.

Figure4 : Schematic flowchart representing Machine learning models

Final Input layers
Output

Any deep learning model requires a large volume and variety of datasets during the training process.
Therefore, to achieve a stable and robust DNN model for yield prediction, a large volume of crop yield
data at all yield ranges (low, medium, high) is required. The data availability at lower and higher yield
ranges is to be ensured to minimise inaccuracies in model predictions. Critical issues in the
operational use of Al models are feature selection, optimization of model parameters, consistency of
results, the scale of model development, etc.

---

<!-- Page 57 -->

‘Two machine learning approaches are mostly followed in the literatures i.e., Decision tree based like
random forest and Deep neural network based. Random forest (RF) is a supervised ensemble learning
model which combines the output of multiple decision trees to make the final prediction. Each
decision tree is trained in isolation and grown in random subspaces of data by using Classification
and Decision Tree (CART) methodology. Deep Neural Networks (DNN) utilizes the principle of
universal approximation theorem which states that a fully connected feed forward neural network
with finite number of layers and neurons can approximate any kind of relationship between input
and the output variables (Fig.4).

2.1. Workflow

Machine learning workflow consists of pre-processing, feature design, splitting data into training and
validation sets, selecting machine learning algorithm, training, optimization, evaluations and
testing. Datasets from various sources, satellite derived, weather, soil and yield need to be
homogenized and aligned to the same spatial and temporal resolutions. Training, validation and
testing datasets need to be mutually explicit.

2.2. Datasets

Crop yield is the result of a complex interaction between weather, edaphic, management factors and
genotypes. Datasets/features must represent these factors and should have physical meaning in
terms of their impact on crop growth and development. Spectral data over the crop is the integrated
manifestation of the effect of all the above factors and hence, satellite data can be used as feature in
the Machine learning models. Table 8 represents various datasets commonly used in the machine
learning models.

2.3. Feature Selection, training and optimization

Feature selection should be performed such that each feature should provide unique information
about crop growth. Crop growing period (start of the season, end of the season) should be considered
for selecting the features. Multivariate analysis needs to be performed to check the multi-collinearity
between the features. Appropriate data normalization technique needs to follow for bringing datasets
to same unit. Gap-filling and outlier removal should be done through standard statistical procedure.

Regularization criteria must be followed to check the overfitting of the model. Optimization function
should be refiected as an output to visualize the learning rate, batch size etc. Feature importance

---

<!-- Page 58 -->

should be computed to check the weightage to each feature. Statistical criteria need to be considered
for accuracy, such as the mathematical expectation of mean absolute of forecast error MAE, RMSE or
NRMSE.

In case of Neural network model, the following parameters need to be explicitly mentioned by the
agency
+ Network Architecture
* Activation function
+ Learning Algorithm
+ Learning rate
+ Loss Function
+ Regularization criteria
+ Number of training epochs
* Batch size
For decision tree-based models the following configuration
+ Number oftrees
+ No, of features randomly selected at each node
+ Best feature selection criteria
+ Minimum Leaf size

Ifany Feature engineering is adopted the its effect on the model performance need to be documented.
2.3.1. Model implementation & Deliverables

Model implementation needs to be done at IU level and the final deliverables will be the modelled yield
of IU for the current and past years.

3. Crop Simulation Model Approach

(This guideline applies whether CSM is applied as a standalone or by assimilating remote sensing
data, see the section on crop assimilation data)

3.1. Brief Description

Crop growth models simulate the plant processes to estimate various bio-physical parameters and
final crop yield. These models need intensive parameterization starting from genetic coefficients of
crop variety under cultivation, crop sowing time, crop management practices - fertilizer applications,
irrigation supplies, pest/disease occurrence, etc., These are highly reliable point-based or location-
specific models due to the availability of input parameters in experimental plots. Calibrated and
validated crop simulation models (DSSAT, APSIM, InfoCrop, etc.,) for Indian conditions together with
soils and cultivar data available locally from SAUs and NBSSLUP. These models are well-calibrated
and validated for several crops such as wheat, rice, maize, sorghum, potato, soybean, chickpea,
mustard, groundnut, cotton, and coconut in Indian agroecological conditions. The following
processes are considered in most of these models:

+ Crop growth and development: phenology, photosynthesis, partitioning, leaf area growth,
storage organ numbers, source: sink balance, transpiration, uptake, allocation, and
redistribution of nitrogen.

+ Effects of water, nitrogen, temperature, flooding, and frost stresses on crop growth and
development.

+ Soil water balance: root water uptake, inter-layer movement, drainage, evaporation, runoff,
ponding.

---

<!-- Page 59 -->

+ Soil nitrogen balance: mineralization, uptake, nitrification, volatilization, interlayer
movement, denitrification, leaching.
+ Soil organic carbon dynamics: mineralization and immobilization.
3.2. Model framework
The crop models are process-based dynamic simulation models for simulating the growth,
development, and yield of crops.

They simulate the effects of weather, soil, and crop management (sowing, seed rate, organic matter
nitrogen, and irrigation), and pests (some models). It provides daily and summary outputs on various
growth and yield parameters, nitrogen uptake, soil water, and nitrogen balance. Several researchers
have shown the application and utility of crop simulation models in India. Below a sample modelling
framework is shown for Info Crop (Fig.5)

Input data in the model includes daily max & min temperature, daily Solar Radiation (IMD AWS),
Daily Rainfall (IMD AWS), Soil data - Depth wise texture, BD, pH, Organic carbon, water holding
capacity, etc. The crop management information such as sowing dates and irrigation information can
be derived from satellite images and used to drive simulation, and other management factors are
taken as per the standard local practices. The output from the CSMs is like yield, total dry matter,
crop duration, evapotranspiration, N uptake, and soil C, N, and water dynamics.

3.3. Key considerations

+ There are several crop-simulation models available in the literature, however, they have varying
accuracy, and only a few of them are tested thoroughly for Indian conditions. Emphasis should be
given to the use of those models that have proven accuracy, and calibrated parameter values (e.g.,
cultivar coefficients) are available.

+ The granularity of outputs derived from CSMs depends on the granularity of input datasets. To
improve the granularity, spatial simulations should be done by considering variations in soil,
weather, and other input parameters like sowing dates. Crop area-based aggregation must be
applied to derive final yields at the IU level.

+ Another approach to improving granularity is to assimilate remote sensing data (e.g., LAI, soil
moisture) in crop simulation models. Such assimilation and subsequent updating of the state
variables in the CSM should be done using methodologies tested and published in peer-reviewed
research journals.

<!-- Page 60 -->

3.4. Methodology

Crop models distinguish varieties of a crop by their differences in phenology, growth, and source-sink
balance. In most cases, thermal times of three phenological phases, the sensitivity to photoperiod,
early vigor (defined in the model as relative LAI growth rate during initial stages), index of storage
organs formation (slope of the relation between SO and growth during SO formation stage), and the
potential weight of the storage organs were sufficient to adequately characterize the varieties.

3.5. Calibration and Validation

Model calibration and validation approaches are required for each selected model for the selected
crop. The simulation models are sensitive to the genetic coefficients of the crop cultivar. A proper
varietal-based approximation of genetic coefficients is required at disaggregated levels before
simulating the crop yield. The calibration process should be done with care, and it should be ensured
that the parameters do not exceed the biological range. The datasets from KVK, SAUs, or ICAR
institutes should be used to check the quality of the simulation.

3.6. Deliverables

‘The final deliverable will be a model yield estimate for the current and at least the past five years for
the given crop at the IU level. -

4. Ensemble models (Machine Learning/ Crop Simulation)
4.1. Brief description

An ensembled approach to yield estimation involves combining the predictions of multiple models to
make a final prediction. This can be done through various techniques such as model averaging,
model voting, or more sophisticated methods such as stacking. One advantage of using an ensembled
approach is that it can improve the accuracy of the yield estimation by reducing the variance of the
predictions. This is because the individual models may make different errors, and by combining their
predictions, the errors can cancel out to some extent. An ensembled approach can also improve the
robustness of the yield estimation, as it can be less sensitive to the specific choice of model or training
data used.

In this approach, input obtained from Simulation and Machine learning approaches will be combined
through scientifically designed techniques. Most accurate results are obtained by ensembling
methods (weighted average, stacking). The Machine Learning approach would be Linear regression,
Random Forest, ExtraTrees, gradient boosting (CatBoost), neural networks (Pytorch Tabnet), k-
nearest neighbours. Simulation models (c.g. ORYZA, WOFOST, Infocrop, DSSAT, APSIM) are used,
along with data assimilation technology. Brief flow diagram of approach is given if Fig. 6.

5. Parametric index of crop performance (Indirect approach)

Satellite-based crop mapping, satellite and weather data analysis for generating crop health
indicators, field data collection and analysis, composite index generation, and insurance loss
assessment are significant tasks in this framework.

A robust system of mobile-based crop surveillance is part of this approach for close and continuous
monitoring of the agricultural situation. These field data points were linked to satellite indices for
crop classification and crop condition assessment.

Refer the methodology section of Semi-physical approach

The following set of indices derived from satellite and weather datasets that are well reported to be
related to crop condition were part ofa vast repository of data in the current project.

+ Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)

+ Land Surface Wetness Index (LSW1)

+ rainy days

+ wind speed

+ humidity

Major input datasets and their details mentioned in the Tables 2,3 &4 under Machine learning
approach and crop simulation approach are also relevant for CHF generation.

5.1. CHF generation

The important elements of the CHF generation procedure include selection of input variables, data
matrix preparation for all the IUs and years, grouping of IUs in each district, data normalization,
weights generation, CHF development.

Fortnightly and monthly time composite NDVI and LSWI images and 12-day interval SAR VH
backscatter images are to be generated covering entire crop season for the current and past years.
Crop layer and shapefile of IUs are used to create the data of sub-indicators. Input parameters of the
model along with their functional relationship with CHF for paddy crop are shown in Table 10.

Table 10: Input parameters of the CHF model for paddy (illustration)

S.No. | Input indicator Functional relationship
with CHF
1 Seasons’ maximum NDVI Positive
2 Season's maximum LSWI Positive
3 Season's maximum VH backscatter Positive
4 Integrated VH backscatter Positive
5 Integrated FAPAR Positive
6 Crop condition variability Negative
r Rainfall Positive
8 Rainy days Positive

---

<!-- Page 63 -->

From the NDVI profile of each year, the maximum NDVI value occurring at nth fortnight and the NDVI
of either n+ 1th or n-1th fortnight, whichever is higher, are averaged. Averaging two values of NDVI
reduces uncertainty and ensures a better representation of the season's maximum value. A similar
approach is adopted for computing the season's maximum LSWI and Backscatter. Integrated VH
backscatter represents the total Backscatter of all the data of the growing season. Integrated FAPAR
(sowing to harvesting) - Monthly composite FAPAR data from September to the first fortnight of
November, when the crop is actively growing and maximum vegetative phase are summed up. The
period of integration varies based on crop season. Crop condition variability is represented by the
maximum of the Coefficient of Variation (CV) values of NDVI and LSWI. CV was computed using mean
and standard deviation of respective index in a given IU.

Justification for the above parameters can be drawn from the published research. Season's
maximum NDVI and LSWI, included in the model, were reported to be effective in crop condition
assessment and crop yield modelling particularly for paddy and wheat crops by many studies. SAR
backscatter data was used to infer the LAI values of rice crop and used them as relative leaf growth
rate parameters in the ORYZA model. Time series data of back scatter offers reliable information
about the crop growth stage, such as jointing and heading in grain crops and leaf development and
reproduction. FAPAR integral over the season is one of the indicators of biomass production from
vegetation. FAPAR integral was already used to design _index-based insurance over grasslands.
FAPAR was also successfully used in grain yield estimation procedures.

Rainfall and rainy days are vital factors in crop production. Rainfall quantity shows differential
effects on crop performance. Increase in rainfall up to certain level benefits the crop and beyond
certain quantity of increase it harms the crop. In this model, consider the benefit-causing limit of
rainfall alone, which is fixed at 150% of normal rainfall. India Meteorological Department defines
normal rainfall limit as 80-120% of long-term average (www.imd.gov.in). We have considered an
additional quantity of 30% assuming that it benefits the water loving paddy crop, and thus fixed the
upper limit of rainfall quantity corresponding to 150% of long-term average. It is assumed that the
negative effects of excess rainfall quantity beyond 150% limit, on crop performance would be
captured by other parameters, i.e., NDVI, LSWI, and Backscatter. The impact of deficit rainfall on
crop would anywhere be reflected in these spectral indices.

5.2. Stratification of the IUs

‘The IUs of each district are first segregated into homogeneous groups based on NDVI, rainfall, and
soil water holding capacity datasets. It is to be ensured that each group consists of at least 4 [Us that
are contiguously located. By pooling contiguous IUs into a group, the number of crop scenarios would
be increased. For example, a group with four [Us and four crop years has 16 crop growing scenarios,
adequate to capture the variability. The dynamic ranges of input indicators of the CHF model are
more or less the same in each group because it represents a homogeneous crop growing environment.
On the other hand, if each IU is treated as a discrete / standalone entity, there are only four crop
growing scenarios, and such a limited database cannot represent the total variability of crop
responses leading to biased weights. All the steps in CHF computation — data normalization, weights
generation, and applying weights for final index generation are carried out in each stratum
independently.

5.3. Datanormalization

The data are first checked for redundancy by comparing inter-correlations between the variables. The
input indicators of the model are in different units. Their functional relationships with CHF is either
positive or negative as mentioned in the Table 5 above. To obtain these indicators unit-free, data
normalization was done by following the widely recommended Min-Max approach.

In the case of the input-indicators that have a positive relationship with CHF, normalization was done
using the formula;

---

<!-- Page 64 -->

In the case of the input-indicators having a negative relationship with CHF, normalization was done
using the formula;

Max{Xij}-Xij
Max (X,}, — Min(y]

5.4. Weights generation and CHF computation

xy =

After normalization, the input indicators range from 0-1. Derivation of weights to input indicators is
vital in constructing composite indices. There are many methods of weight generation in a composite
data framework.

Feature extraction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis, Partial Least Squares, multi-
criteria decision models are also used to aggregate different variables into a single index. But linearity
assumption in data transformation is a serious limitation in most feature extraction techniques.
Entropy technique based on information theory depends on the disorder degree of information. It is a
more effective information measure providing balanced relationships and unbiased weights better
than linear methods. The entropy-based weighting technique is recommended, considering its
merits. The entropy-derived variability of a feature and its weight are directly related. This technique
does not include any assumptions, cumbersome derivations, and transformations.

Consider a normalized data matrix D which consists of observation for features, where x,denotes the
value of the j* feature of i* observation. The entropy of the j" feature, E,, can be calculated as:

The weight of the feature can then be calculated as:

5.6. Blending CHF with CCE Yields

70% weightage to CCE-yield deviation from its threshold and 30% weightage to CHF deviation from
its threshold. However, State can increase the weightage for CHF deviation, at their discretion.
Weightage to be assigned to CHF deviations needs to be declared in the beginning of crop season, and
mentioned in tender documents.

Appendix 2
(Refer Clause 1.5.4)

Crop Model Matrix -2 (CMM - 2)

1. Introduction

1.1. Yield Estimation System based on Technology (YES-TECH) is being implemented from kharif.
2023, towards enabling large scale adoption of technology-based yield estimates for yield loss
and insurance claim assessments under PMFBY.

1.2. The Department has constituted an Expert Committee for monitoring the implementation of
YES-TECH under PMFBY. The purpose of YES-TECH is to blend the technology-based yield
estimates with manual yield estimates and reduce the dependence on manual system
gradually.

1.3. The CMM1 rolled out in 2023-24 season covers paddy and wheat crops with
five models for yield estimation. SOPs for all the five notified models and
implementation modalities are documented in YES-TECH manual 2023
(https: //pmfby.gov.in/pdf/YES_TECH_Manual_2023.pdf).

2. Coverage of additional crops under YES-TECH

2.1. Towards increasing the number of crops under YES-TECH, the Department has initiated pilot
studies in 2022-23 crop seasons covering non-cereal crops.

2.2. The objective of these pilot studies was to generate reliable yield estimates through scalable
models for non-cereal crops at IU level. These pilot studies were conducted in Kharif 2022-23
for 5 major non-cereal crops including maize, soybean, bajra, cotton and guar. Ten agencies
were involved in these studies covering 25 districts across different agro-climatic zones of
India

2.3. The agencies have used innovative technologies/data like high spatio-temporal resolution
remote sensing data, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), advanced crop simulation models,
artificial intelligence/machine learning, soil, weather & crop data, picture based analysis,
advanced statistics, etc to crop mapping and yield modelling.

3. Evaluation of pilot studies

3.1 The Department has constituted an Expert Committee to review implementations and the
results of pilot studies on GP level yield estimations of cereal and non-cereal crops under
PMFBY vide letter number F.No. 11019/04/2019-Cr. II dated 24th November 2022. The
terms of reference of the committee includes i) selecting the agency based on defined criteria ii)
recommending the cost of each study, iii) carrying out mid-terms and final review of the
studies and iv) Recommendation of most optimum approach to be adopted in PMFBY.

3.2 The committee conducted the final review meeting on 15th March 2024 and evaluated the
results of gram panchayat level technology-based yield estimation for non-cereal crops
executed by various agencies during Kharif 2022-23. The committee has also examined the
results of non-cereal crop yield estimation in MahaAgriTech, Maharashtra and MP AgriGIS,
Madhya Pradesh States for soybean and cotton crops.

3.3 The expert committee found the results achieved under the above pilot studies as well as the
results of MahaAgriTech and MP AgriGIS projects for soybean crop are highly encouraging
and satisfactory.

3.4 Based on the review meeting, the expert committee has recommended the inclusion of
soybean crop under YES-TECH program.

‘Subsequent CMMs

4.1 Para 1.5.3 of YES-TECH Manual 2023 stipulates that “Gol will notify subsequent CMMs from.
time to time based on the recommendations of YES-TECH Committee.”

4.2 Para 1.5.4 of YES-TECH Manual 2023 stipulates that “Upon such notifications on subsequent
CMMs relevant details will be added as appendices to this manual.”

4.3 According to these provisions of YES-TECH Manual 2023 and the recommendations of YES-
TECH Committee, CMM2 will be implemented for tech-based yield estimation in Soybean crop
from Kharif 2024 in PMFBY implementing States/UTTs.

5. CMM2

‘The CMM2 includes technology-based yield estimation for soybean crop under YES-TECH
program.

5.1 Rationale for CMM2

Results of the pilot studies by agencies on technology-based yield estimation are promising for
soybean crop. The technology-based yield estimation of soybean crop is operational in
Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh States through their MahaAgriTech and MPAgriGIS
projects and results achieved thereof are highly encouraging and satisfactory.

5.2 Coverage
‘The following soybean cultivating States shall be covered under CMM2-
1.) Madhya Pradesh, 2.) Maharashtra, 3.) Rajasthan, 4.) Karnataka and 5.) Telangana
5.3 CMM2 Models
‘The following modelling approaches are recommended.

i. Semi-physical,

ii. Machine Learning,
iii, Crop simulation and
iv, Ensemble approach.

The technical details of the modelling approaches are provided in section 4 of the YES-TECH
manual 2023

5.4 Yield Data Requirement

5.4.1 States should provide a minimum of 150 supervised CCE based yield measurements data per
district in each year of implementation in order to support technology-based yield modelling
system.

5.4.2 CCE derived soybean crop yield estimates at Insurance Unit level for the last 3-5 years (as per
availability) shall be provided by States for model training purposes.

5.4.3 The above yield data shall be used for model development purpose only and it shalll not be used
to raise disputes on the modelled yield estimates since the model performance was already
evaluated before including in YES-TECH program.

5.4.4 It is recommended that the modelled yield should be given at least 30% in the blending
approach. Crops and choice of yield models to be covered under YES-TECH are notified from
time to time based on the maturity level of technology models.

---

<!-- Page 77 -->

6. Specific terms and conditions
6.1 _ Districts growing soybean crop in at least 5000 ha of area shall only be included.

6.2 Within each selected district, Insurance Unit covering at least 100 ha of soybean crop area
shall only be included.

6.3 1Us growing less than 100 ha of soybean area shall be merged with nearest neighbour IUs for
yield modelling.

6.4 Satellite based crop mapping is a prerequisite for YES-TECH- implementation. If crop
mapping is not possible for any Insurance Unit due to small and isolated fields or very low
coverage, it is recommended to exclude such IUs from YES-TECH and adopt only conventional
CCE System. State can take a decision to merge such [Us with contiguous IUs and implement
the models.

Reference Cost for TIP for Implementing YES-TECH

7.1 The institutional mechanism for CMM2 implementation is same as that of CMM1 comprising
of Mentor Institutes for Technology Rollout (MITR) for providing mentorship to the States/UTs
and Technical Implementation Partners (TIPs) for the overall implementation of YES-TECH in
the state.

7.2 Thereference cost for implementing CMM2 is same as that of CMM1 mentioned in YES-TECH
Manual 2023 which works out to be Rs. 6-8 lakhs/crop/season/district.

7.3 In the districts, where both CMM1 and CMM2 are implemented in the same season, an
additional cost of Rs. 2-3 lakhs per district is applicable to over and above the standard
reference cost of Rs. 6-8 lakhs. For other information related to reference cost provided in
section 5.3.2 of YES-TECH manual 2023 is also applicable to CMM2.

8. Other terms and conditions

8.1 YESTECH manual 2023 shall be referred for all other terms and conditions, implementation
modalities, administrative and financial matters etc.

wheat crop in 12 districts during Rabi 2023-24 season and paddy crop in 5 Clusters during Rabi
2023-24 season for implementation of YES-TECH.
Further Bidder-1 has quoted average rate of Rs. 800/- per Clusters for paddy and wheat crop in both
Kharif and Rabi seasons. Therefore, total amount quoted by Bidder-1 for paddy crop in Kharif 2023
will be 15 x 800 = Rs. 12,000/-, total amount quoted by Bidder-1 for wheat crop in Rabi 2023-24 will
be 12x 800 = Rs. 9,600/- and total amount quoted by Bidder-1 for paddy crop in Rabi 2023-24 will be

5x800 = Rs. 4,000/-.

Accordingly, similar calculation can be done for remaining seasons of the tender cycle and Bidder-1
will arrive at cumulative total of Rs. 94,400/- for six seasons for CMM-1.

as notified by the respective States/UTs.

12.3. Reference Crop: Crop having highest area in the /cluster/state (as the case may be), in
the previous year, in CMM-1 or subsequent CMMs will be considered as reference crop for
calculating the cost for crops notified under subsequent CMMs.

12.4. The cost for subsequent CMM will be discovered by taking the cost per unit area, of the
reference crop in the relevant clusters.

12.5. In case of implementation of subsequent CMM in a cluster where CMM-1 has not been
implemented, the rate for subsequent CMMs will be discovered through the cost per unit
area of the reference crop at state level

12.6. For any change in crops or district, the TIP should duly be informed and the same shall be
binding on the TIP.

12.7. Payment shall be made as per the actual execution of work based on season wise rate

Example: In Rabi 2023-24 wheat and paddy crops covered under CMM-1. Previous year area of
Paddy (170 ha) is greater than area of wheat (130 ha). In this case paddy crop will be considered as
reference crop for Rabi 2023-24 season. Further, for discovering the cost of subsequent CMM crop i.e.
Gram, the cost will be calculated by L1 rate per cluster for Paddy Crop (800) divided by area of
reference crop (170) i.e. 800/170=4.70 Rs. /hectare multiplied by area of subsequent crop Gram i.e.
80*4.70=376 Rs. /cluster.
